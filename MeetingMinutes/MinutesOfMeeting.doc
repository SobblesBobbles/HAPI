We agreed that the data that was to be pulled down from Firebase needed to be formatted into two ways. One for a high level of detail for Doctors and Nurses to interpret and another that could be possibly exported as a 'family friendly version' as an email or PDF for family members to understand what is the current update of their sick family member.
